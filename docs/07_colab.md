# 07 — Run the notebook in Google Colab

## Goal
Run the same notebook without installing anything.

---

## Option A — Upload the notebook
1) Go to: https://colab.google/
2) File → Upload notebook…
3) Upload: `notebooks/00_notebook_demo.ipynb`
4) Runtime → Run all

---

## Option B — Open from GitHub (after this repo is public)
In Colab:
- File → Open notebook → GitHub tab
- Paste the repo URL
- Select the notebook

---

## Save your work
Colab is a browser tool. To avoid losing work:
- File → Save a copy in Drive
OR
- File → Download → `.ipynb`

---

## One key difference vs VS Code
Colab runs on a remote machine.
That’s awesome for convenience — but file paths and local files behave differently.
